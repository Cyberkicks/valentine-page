# Simple Valentine page

Open [index.html](index.html) in any modern browser to use the page. Copy the folder to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.) and share the URL in your email.

Behavior:
- Clicking **No** changes the No button text through a sequence and makes the **Yes** button grow.
- Clicking **Yes** shows a short celebratory message.

To test locally:
```bash
# on Windows - open the file directly
start index.html
# or serve with a tiny server (optional)
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```
